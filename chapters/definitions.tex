\paragraph{Convexity}\index{convexity} Used to describe a special case of the general constrained optimization problem in which
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep,noitemsep]
    \item The objective function is convex
    \item The equality constraint functions $c_i(\cdot)$, $i \in \mathcal{E}$ are linear, and
    \item The inequality constraint functions$c_i(\cdot)$, $i \in \mathcal{I}$ are concave
\end{itemize}
